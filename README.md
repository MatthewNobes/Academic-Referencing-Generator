# Academics Reference Generator

I created this project as a way to generate references for my final year dissertation at university. The aim is to build this tool that can be used to generate references in many different types of referencing standards, and provide advice on document structure and formatting. 

It is also likely that in the future this application will be hosted using GitHub pages, enabling other users to utilise this service for their own bibliographies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
This project has jest running along side it and I endeavour to continue the rest of the project using test oriented programming. 

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
